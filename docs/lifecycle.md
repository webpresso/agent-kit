# Blueprint lifecycle

A blueprint is a Markdown + YAML-frontmatter implementation plan that
moves through a handful of discrete states. The state machine is
deliberately small — it's more important that it be enforced than that
it have lots of transitions.

## States

| State | Directory | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `draft` | `blueprints/draft/<slug>/` | Freshly created. Still being scoped. May reference unverified claims. Not ready to execute. |
| `planned` | `blueprints/planned/<slug>/` | Refined, fact-checked, task graph ready. Can be picked up by an agent. Tasks haven't started. |
| `in-progress` | `blueprints/in-progress/<slug>/` | At least one task has started. Progress tracked in `_overview.md` frontmatter (`progress:` field) and via per-task `**Status:**` annotations. |
| `completed` | `blueprints/completed/<slug>/` | Every task marked `done`. Acceptance criteria ticked. Ready for archival. |
| `archived` | `blueprints/archived/<slug>/` | Historical record. Read-only. |
| `parked` | `blueprints/parked/<slug>/` | Paused indefinitely. Reason captured in frontmatter. Re-enters `draft/` or `planned/` on resume. |

## Transitions

```
                                       ┌─ parked ◄──┐
                                       │            │
   ┌──────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌──────▼──────┐     │
   │draft │────►│ planned │────►│ in-progress │──┬──┘
   └──────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────────┘  │
                                                 ▼
                                           ┌───────────┐     ┌──────────┐
                                           │ completed │────►│ archived │
                                           └───────────┘     └──────────┘
```

Rules:

- **`draft → planned`** requires the plan pass format audit (`ak blueprint audit <slug> --strict`) and ideally `/plan-refine`. Enforced by `ak blueprint move <slug> planned` — the move command refuses if the audit fails.
- **`planned → in-progress`** is automatic on `ak blueprint start <slug>` or when an agent calls `ak blueprint task <slug> <task-id> start`. Don't manually move between these two states.
- **`in-progress → completed`** requires every task's checklist ticked and frontmatter `status: completed` set. `ak blueprint finalize <slug>` validates and transitions.
- **`completed → archived`** is manual (`ak blueprint move <slug> archived`) and signals "this historical record should stay but isn't referenced by active work."
- **`→ parked`** can happen from `planned` or `in-progress` (`ak blueprint move <slug> parked`). Frontmatter gains a `parked_reason:` field.
- **`parked → planned`** / **`parked → in-progress`** is the resume path.

## Frontmatter fields

Minimum required:

```yaml
---
type: blueprint
status: draft        # draft | planned | in-progress | completed | archived | parked
complexity: M        # XS | S | M | L | XL — t-shirt sizing
created: 2026-04-22
last_updated: 2026-04-22
progress: '0% (0 of N tasks completed)'
---
```

Optional (common):

```yaml
depends_on:
  - name-of-other-blueprint
  - >-
    name-of-other-blueprint (planned) — note about why this is a dependency
tags:
  - infra
  - cloudflare
parked_reason: >-
  Waiting on upstream decision about <X>. Resume when <Y> lands.
completed_at: 2026-04-22
# execution_backend is omitted for the package-core lifecycle; optional runtimes may set their adapter name
max_parallel_agents: 3
```

`complexity` is enforced:

- **XS** — single-session one-liner; often just a config change.
- **S** — one focused chunk of work; ≤ 1 dev-day.
- **M** — 2–5 phases, multiple tasks per phase.
- **L** — cross-cutting. Multiple packages touched.
- **XL** — needs to be broken down further. Usually a sign the blueprint should become a parent roadmap with child blueprints.

## Task shape

Each task lives under a phase heading (`### Phase N: <name>`):

```markdown
#### [lane] Task 1.1: Short imperative name

- [ ] **Status:** todo | in_progress | blocked | done
- **Depends on:** — | Task 1.2 | Task 1.2, Task 2.3
- **Files:** path/to/file.ts, path/to/other.ts
- **Change:** one-liner describing the delta.
- **Verify:** the command that proves it worked.
- **Acceptance:** the observable outcome that closes the task.
```

Rules (enforced by the `blueprint-plan` docs-linter validator at
`@webpresso/agent-kit/docs-linter`):

- Task headings use **four** hashes (`####`), not three.
- Task IDs are numeric dotted (`1.1`, `1.2a`, `2.3.1`), never bare.
- Dependencies use the `Task X.Y` form, not bare `X.Y`.
- Executable blueprints (`status: planned|in-progress|completed`) must
  use canonical task statuses only: `todo | in_progress | blocked | done`.
- Every executable task must include explicit `**Status:**`.

## Blueprint scoping rule

Per `.agent/rules/blueprint-scoping.md` (in the agent-kit catalog):

> New blueprints that extend or replace enabling-layer infrastructure
> (runtime, schema engine, agent fabric, session DOs, policy engine,
> workflow runner) MUST name a product-wedge in the current VISION stage
> that directly consumes the new capability. Blueprints without that
> anchor stay in `draft/` or move to `archived/`.

Infra blueprints either anchor to a user-visible capability or wait.
This keeps the backlog honest.

## Common operations

```bash
ak blueprint new "<goal>" --complexity M        # create draft
ak blueprint list                                # all statuses
ak blueprint list --status planned               # filter
ak blueprint show <slug>                         # detail view
ak blueprint audit <slug> --strict               # format + lifecycle check
ak blueprint audit --all --strict                # everything
ak blueprint move <slug> planned                 # transition (audit-gated)
ak blueprint start <slug>                        # planned → in-progress
ak blueprint task <slug> 1.1 start               # task → in_progress
ak blueprint task <slug> 1.1 complete            # task → done
ak blueprint task <slug> 1.1 block --reason "<why>"
ak blueprint task <slug> 1.1 unblock
ak blueprint finalize <slug>                     # all tasks done → completed
ak blueprint move <slug> archived                # keep record
ak blueprint diff <slug>                         # history
ak blueprint graph <slug>                        # render task DAG as mermaid
```

For parallel lane launch, Agent Kit exposes the Blueprint DAG and lifecycle
primitives. Runtime-specific adapters such as OMX `/pll` are optional layers
that may consume those primitives, but they are not required for the public
package core.
